Arised from the flexibity of its data structure, graph is a useful tool to describe relations among entities and has been applied to domains such social science, biology etc. In contrast, graph has been seldomly utilized to depict micro-level traffic. In this post, we discuss the usage of graphs on micro-level traffic cases, coupled with recurrent neural network.  

Graph for Traffic
======
# Car-Following Models
Car-Following models is a family of models that predict the longitudinal behaviors (brake, accelerate) of the ego-vehicle (vehicle of our interests). Assuming the ego-vehicle reacts to its surrounding traffic, the literature often adopts interactions between the ego-vehicle and its surrounding vehicles as model inputs. The number of interactions considered in the model varies across the spectrum of studies.
