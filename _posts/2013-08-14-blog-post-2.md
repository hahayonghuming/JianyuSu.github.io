This is a brief introduction to Jianyu Su, as a human-beling.

## Who am I
Jianyu Su, a male, a boy, a man, a son or whatever I am (I am straight but I support LGBTQ). I currently live at Charlottesville. I like coffee and I spent a lot of time at [Shenandoah Joe](https://shenandoahjoe.com/) (I would really appreciate it if they can upgrade their wifi) prior to the pandemic. I have been at Charlottesville for more than 5 years and it is my second hometown now. During the pandemic, I get bored very easily if I am not working on projects. The solution to that is either play some Nintendo Games or take my Q50 out for a spin. You cannot believe how many times that I have drove without a destination in my mind during the pandemic.
