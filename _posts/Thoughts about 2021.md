Look backed at 2021, I am surprised by how my 2021 was unfolded. "Sweet bitter" (not bitter sweet) best summarizes my experiences. That is, I managed to see some positive
things among a series of unfortunate things.

The first and the most important keyword of the year is "racism". I have gone through several incidents of racism since I went to U.S. in 2015. But none of them 
shook my belief that "All men are created equal" than the incident where a black colleague recklessly attacked asian scholars and labelled us as "over-represented in the academia".
BLM was just fueled by the tradgic death of George Floyd and of course everyone in the department turned a blind eye on this incident, including the leadership in the department
at University of Virginia. Initially, I was too innocent to believe that academia is equal for everyone as reseachers, regardless of their color, are only judged by
the quality of research. And I was later staggered by the reality. Some black sholars claimed that "It is more difficult for a black scholar to succee in academia" and blah blah. 
I would advise all those people stop whining, and do not live in a cave. Check the news like a white professor fake her black identity to get tenure. Go to google scholar to search your asian
collegues and see how many top journal papers they need to just be your collegue.
