This is a brief introduction to Jianyu Su, as a human-beling.

## Who Am I
Jianyu Su (苏健宇), a male, a boy, a man, a Chinese or whatever I am (I am straight but I support LGBTQ). I currently live at Charlottesville. I like coffee and I spent a lot of time at [Shenandoah Joe](https://shenandoahjoe.com/) (I would really appreciate it if they can upgrade their wifi) prior to the pandemic. I like bakery, especially those from [MarieBette](http://www.mariebette.com/), but I am only allowed to eat once per week for bodybuilding reasons. I have been at Charlottesville for more than 5 years and it is my second hometown now. During the pandemic, I get bored very easily when I am not working on projects. The solution to that is either play some Nintendo Games or take my Q50 out for a spin. You cannot believe how many times that I have drove without a destination in my mind during the pandemic.

## My Hobbies
- I like cooking. But I get bored with it quickly. To reduce the time and efforts I spend on cooking, I only eat one or two meals during the pandemic.
- I like video games (mostly JRPG). I recommend Persona 5, Zelda, and Hades. Believe it or not, I am good at just dance.
- I like sports and bodybuilding. I was 165 lbs prior pandemic and I could back squat over 310 lbs without breaking a sweat. Now I am 143 lbs and I don't know how much weight I am capable to lift. I also enjoy running and I did one Charlottesville 10 Miler.
- I like animations and comics (mostly Japanese ones). Recently I have been following 鬼灭之刃 (Demon Slayer), 咒术回战 (Jujutsu Kaisen), and 全员恶玉(Akudama Drive).
- I like watermelons so much that I was seriously considering changing my name to Watermelon Su when I was a 2nd-grader.

## What I dislike
- Ginger and asian celery. I cannot stand their smell.
- Chicken breast. I ate chicken breast for a whole year when I started bodybuilidng.
- Food with bad taste. I can only eat a limited number of meals so why not eat delicious food.
- Anything that get in the way of whatever I am doing. I am very focused when I am doing research, working out and I hate it if I get distracted.
- People that are not punctual. I don't like waiting.

## Social Life
I don't use social media (facebook, twitter, instagram etc.). I might have created accounts years ago but I never used them. I have a number of friends that I interact on daily basis (of course follow the no-more-than-10-people-gathering guidline). We potluck most of time, drink seldomly. 

Prior to pandemic, I went to gym with my buddies almost every day. And now I play Call of Duty Warzone with them lol.

## Work Life
I am a member of UVA link Lab and I have a seat in it. Only in pandemic, I found out that I spent too much time socializing with people because the link lab is a open space as well as I am a popular guy haha. I might get dragged into some random conversations whenever some guys pass by my seat (I miss it). I work from home since March 2020. I like to work while listening to kpop and I have good reasons for that:
- Kpop is catchy. It is definitely good to listen to.
- I don't understand Korean so I don't get distracted by lyrics. I did need to turn down the volumn if I am doing some serious work.
- Kpop girls bands are aesthetically pleasing, relieving me from pressure, fatigue.

My favorite boys bands are GOT 7 and EXO. My favorite girls bands are TWICE, IZONE, Red Velvet, EVERGLOW, and ITZY.
