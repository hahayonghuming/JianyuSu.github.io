# About Me
* I am excited to begin my new journey as a machine learning engineer @JD.com (doctoral management trainee) in July 2021.
* I am a Ph.D. who graduated from [Systems Engineering Program](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/engineering-systems-and-environment/academics/systems-engineering) at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) in May 2021, advised by [Prof. Peter A. Beling](https://facultydirectory.virginia.edu/faculty/pb3a). ([Download my Resume](https://hahayonghuming.github.io/JianyuSu.github.io/files/Jianyu_Su_s_Resume.pdf)) My research research involves deep learning algorithms, V2V communication applications and autonomous driving. I am passinate about autonomous driving and the future of mobility.
* I was also a member of UVa [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab), a research center that conducts pioneering research in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). I conduct multidisciplinary research with fellow researchers from Computer Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering department.
* My research interests lie in the area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and graph learning, as well as their applications in cyber physical systems such smart cities, smart manufacturing lines.
