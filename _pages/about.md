* I was also a member of UVa [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab), a research center that conducts pioneering research in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). I conduct multidisciplinary research with fellow researchers from Computer Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering department.
* My research interests lie in the area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and graph learning, as well as their applications in cyber physical systems such smart cities, smart manufacturing lines.
* I am excited to begin my new journey as I will join autonoumous driving team @ JD.com as a doctoral management trainee in July 2021.
